### Description
The *Holiday Movies* dataset is a collection that focuses on movies with themes or titles related to various holidays. It spans various genres, years, and holiday themes, looking at how holiday movies have evolved over time and how audiences have received them. This dataset looks at popularity, genre distribution, and temporal trends.

### Provenance
The dataset is courtesy of the Tidy Tuesday project and can be found on their official GitHub [repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-12-12). The origin of the data is IMDb's Non-Commercial datasets. The criteria for including a movie in this dataset were very simple. All works that had "Holiday" in the title were included, as well as those that had specific types of holidays in the title ("Christmas", "Hannukah" and "Kwanzaa").

### Structure & Types of Data
Let us look at the first 5 lines of the data:
```{python}
#| label: show-data
#| message: false

data.head()
```

The dataset contains 2266 lines and 14 columns. The data contains both numerical and categorical features. The *genres* column is essentially a set that contains multiple values, since a movie can belong to multiple genres.

### Rationale for Selecting
The dataset offers rich data with both numerical and categorical features that span over multiple decades. The data is broad enough to allow for creative research yet does not require deep domain knowledge. This makes it a good choice for a team with varied backgrounds.

## Questions

### Question 1
We will look at the trends in popular holiday movies over the decades. Considering the movies with average ratings that fall in the range between the 3rd and 4th quartiles, we will show in which directions holiday movies have been evolving in terms of genres, duration, and lengths of titles.

### Question 2
We will look at the correlations between movie features (such as year of produciton, duration, length of title, rating, genres, and type of holiday) and the amount of earnings the movie generated. For that, we will supplement the existing dataset with box office information using IMDb's API. These observations may be useful in developing a model for estimating the investment worthiness of a movie (whether in production stage or adding an existing movie to a portfolio).

## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).
