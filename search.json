    "text": "Description\nThe Holiday Movies dataset is a collection that focuses on movies with themes or titles related to various holidays. It spans various genres, years, and holiday themes, looking at how holiday movies have evolved over time and how audiences have received them. By selecting the Holiday Movies dataset, we leverage a rich compilation of data to explore changes in popularity, genre preferences, and financial success over time.Our goal is to uncover patterns and insights that could inform future film production and marketing strategies.\n\nProvenance\nThe dataset is courtesy of the Tidy Tuesday project and can be found on their official GitHub repository. The origin of the data is IMDb’s Non-Commercial datasets. The criteria for including a movie in this dataset were very simple. All works that had “Holiday” in the title were included, as well as those that had specific types of holidays in the title (“Christmas”, “Hannukah” and “Kwanzaa”).\n\n\nStructure & Types of Data\nLet us look at the first 5 lines of the data:\n\ndata.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntconst\ntitle_type\nprimary_title\noriginal_title\nyear\nruntime_minutes\ngenres\nsimple_title\naverage_rating\nnum_votes\nchristmas\nhanukkah\nkwanzaa\nholiday\n\n\n\n\n0\ntt0020356\nmovie\nSailor's Holiday\nSailor's Holiday\n1929\n58.0\nComedy\nsailors holiday\n5.4\n55\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n1\ntt0020823\nmovie\nThe Devil's Holiday\nThe Devil's Holiday\n1930\n80.0\nDrama,Romance\nthe devils holiday\n6.0\n242\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n2\ntt0020985\nmovie\nHoliday\nHoliday\n1930\n91.0\nComedy,Drama\nholiday\n6.3\n638\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n3\ntt0021268\nmovie\nHoliday of St. Jorgen\nPrazdnik svyatogo Yorgena\n1930\n83.0\nComedy\nholiday of st jorgen\n7.4\n256\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n4\ntt0021377\nmovie\nSin Takes a Holiday\nSin Takes a Holiday\n1930\n81.0\nComedy,Romance\nsin takes a holiday\n6.1\n740\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us look at the shape of the data:\n\ndata.shape\n\n(2265, 14)\n\n\nThe dataset contains 2265 rows and 14 columns. The data contains both numerical and categorical features. The genres column is essentially a set that contains multiple values, since a movie can belong to multiple genres.\n\n\nRationale for Selecting\nThe dataset offers rich data with both numerical and categorical features that span over multiple decades. The data is broad enough to allow for creative research yet does not require deep domain knowledge. This makes it a good choice for a team with varied backgrounds."

    "text": "How have popular movies changed over the decades?\n\nIntroduction\nThe objective of the proposed analysis is to explore the evolution of popular holiday movies across decades. The focus will be on movies with average ratings in the upper two quartiles, which suggests a positive reception from viewers. This subset of data is essential to understand the shifting preferences of the audience in terms of genre, movie duration, and title length. By isolating films that are more favored, we aim to identify patterns that signify what attributes contribute to the success and popularity of holiday movies.\nTo answer this question, we will employ specific parts of the dataset that include the title, release year, genre, duration, and ratings of each movie. An additional variable—Title Length—will be calculated to examine the correlation between the length of a movie’s title and its popularity. Rating quartiles will be used to classify movies into different levels of reception. Furthermore, the Genre Count will provide insights into the complexity and variety within holiday movies. This analysis is not just a reflection of cinematic trends but also serves to illuminate the changing cultural landscape surrounding holiday themes in films, thus offering valuable information to both film enthusiasts and industry analysts.\n\n\nApproach\nTo address the question of how popular holiday movies have changed over the decades, our approach will involve a blend of descriptive statistics and visual analysis. Firstly, we will perform quartile analysis to categorize movies based on their average ratings. This method segments the data into four equal parts, allowing us to focus specifically on movies in the 3rd to 4th quartile range, which are deemed popular by viewers. Quartile analysis is an effective way to filter the dataset and ensure that the subsequent trends we observe are representative of films that have been well-received, providing a clear picture of what attributes are associated with higher ratings.\nFor the visual analysis, two types of plots will be created. The first plot will be a multi-faceted bar chart that illustrates the distribution of genres within the top quartiles over different decades. By using color mapping, we will be able to distinguish between genres within the same time frame easily, which will enable us to identify any shifts in genre popularity or diversification trends. The second plot will be a scatter plot correlating movie duration and average rating, with movies also color-coded based on their title length. This will allow us to observe if there’s a preferred movie length that correlates with higher ratings, and whether longer or shorter movie titles are trending among the more popular films. The use of facets will further enhance this analysis by breaking down these trends by decade, giving us a temporal perspective on how these relationships have evolved over time. Both methods combined will provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of popular holiday movies, highlighting changes in consumer preferences and industry patterns.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport missingno as msno\n\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/holiday_movies.csv')\n# display the first five rows of the dataset\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntconst\ntitle_type\nprimary_title\noriginal_title\nyear\nruntime_minutes\ngenres\nsimple_title\naverage_rating\nnum_votes\nchristmas\nhanukkah\nkwanzaa\nholiday\n\n\n\n\n0\ntt0020356\nmovie\nSailor's Holiday\nSailor's Holiday\n1929\n58.0\nComedy\nsailors holiday\n5.4\n55\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n1\ntt0020823\nmovie\nThe Devil's Holiday\nThe Devil's Holiday\n1930\n80.0\nDrama,Romance\nthe devils holiday\n6.0\n242\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n2\ntt0020985\nmovie\nHoliday\nHoliday\n1930\n91.0\nComedy,Drama\nholiday\n6.3\n638\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n3\ntt0021268\nmovie\nHoliday of St. Jorgen\nPrazdnik svyatogo Yorgena\n1930\n83.0\nComedy\nholiday of st jorgen\n7.4\n256\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n4\ntt0021377\nmovie\nSin Takes a Holiday\nSin Takes a Holiday\n1930\n81.0\nComedy,Romance\nsin takes a holiday\n6.1\n740\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# check data info\ndf.info()\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 2265 entries, 0 to 2264\nData columns (total 14 columns):\n #   Column           Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n---  ------           --------------  -----  \n 0   tconst           2265 non-null   object \n 1   title_type       2265 non-null   object \n 2   primary_title    2265 non-null   object \n 3   original_title   2265 non-null   object \n 4   year             2265 non-null   int64  \n 5   runtime_minutes  2076 non-null   float64\n 6   genres           2233 non-null   object \n 7   simple_title     2265 non-null   object \n 8   average_rating   2265 non-null   float64\n 9   num_votes        2265 non-null   int64  \n 10  christmas        2265 non-null   bool   \n 11  hanukkah         2265 non-null   bool   \n 12  kwanzaa          2265 non-null   bool   \n 13  holiday          2265 non-null   bool   \ndtypes: bool(4), float64(2), int64(2), object(6)\nmemory usage: 185.9+ KB\n\n\nThe data has 14 columns with varying data types.\n\n# check data shape\ndf.shape\n\n(2265, 14)\n\n\nThe data has 2265 rows and 14 columns.\n\nnew_genres = pd.read_csv('data/holiday_movie_genres.csv')\n# display the first five rows of the dataset\nnew_genres.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntconst\ngenres\n\n\n\n\n0\ntt0020356\nComedy\n\n\n1\ntt0020823\nDrama\n\n\n2\ntt0020823\nRomance\n\n\n3\ntt0020985\nComedy\n\n\n4\ntt0020985\nDrama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\nWe performed exploratory data analysis to discover insights and trends in the dataset based on the variables.

    "text": "What kind of holiday movies earn the most money?\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe will look at the correlations between movie features (such as year of production, duration, length of title, rating, genres, and type of holiday) and the amount of earnings the movie generated. For that, we will supplement the existing dataset with box office information using IMDb’s API. These observations may be useful in developing a model for estimating the investment worthiness of a movie (whether in production stage or adding an existing movie to a portfolio).\n\n\n\nApproach\n\nAt first glance, the tconst column in the dataset may seem redundant. After all, we have the indices, why would we need other identifiers? These variables become useful when we need to get additional data about the movies. Using IMDB’s API, we will populate a new column called earnings. It will allow us to answer our question and make additional useful observations.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nIn order to not expose the API key and not to waste many minutes of time on real-time execution, the code below is not executable. Instead, we will generate the earnings column once, update a copy of our dataset and have it readily available in the /data folder. The function below does just that: using the tconst variable, it makes a call to IMDb’s API and returns the gross movie earnings.\n\nimport json\nimport boto3\n\n\ndef get_earnings(tconst)\n    # Instantiate DataExchange client\n    CLIENT = boto3.client('dataexchange', region_name='us-east-1')\n\n    DATA_SET_ID = '&lt;Dataset ID&gt;'\n    REVISION_ID = '&lt;Revision ID&gt;'\n    ASSET_ID    = '&lt;Asset ID&gt;'\n    API_KEY     = '&lt;API Key&gt;'\n\n    query = \"\"\"\n    {title(id: tconst) {\n        # Get the international opening weekend gross for WALL·E\n        openingWeekendGross(boxOfficeArea: INTERNATIONAL) {\n        gross {\n            total {\n            amount\n            currency\n            }\n        }\n        # Get the date of the opening weekend end date\n        weekendEndDate\n        }\n    }\n    }\n    \"\"\"\n\n    METHOD = 'POST'\n    PATH = '/v1'\n\n    response = CLIENT.send_api_asset(\n        DataSetId=DATA_SET_ID,\n        RevisionId=REVISION_ID,\n        AssetId=ASSET_ID,\n        Method=METHOD,\n        Path=PATH,\n        Body=BODY,\n        RequestHeaders={\n            'x-api-key': API_KEY\n        },\n    )\n\n    return response['Data']['gross']\nDisclaimer: IMDb’s API is extremely pricey, so we do not make actual calls, but rather simulate the data for demonstrative purposes. However, all the shown functions and actions have been carefully crafted in accordance with IMDb’s API documentation. They will work provided a valid API key\nWe load the data in and convert the values into millions of USD by dividing every value by 1,000,000.

    "text": "Approach\n 1. We investigated correlations between movie features and earnings, and by utilizing IMDb’s API to supplement dataset with box office information. 2. which Populated a new “earnings” column using IMDb’s API and unique movie identifiers (tconst), enabling analysis without exposing API key or executing real-time calls. 3. Generate earnings data once and update a copy of the dataset in the /data folder to avoid repeated API calls and ensure efficiency. 4. Ensure data security by not exposing the API key and minimize processing time by pre-fetching earnings data."

The duration of the film did not greatly affect the ratings.\nThe highest-grossing movies are those with Hanukkah themes, followed by traditional Christmas blockbusters. Films with a Kwanzaa or holiday theme made less money. Particular seasonal themes seem to be the most profitable, particularly Hanukkah and Christmas."
